Developers are often interested in joining the open source universe based on a set of motivations. Our mission is to provide the connection between open source projects who desire new contributors and interested developers who want to contribute.

## Submit Project
We are still under development. In a few weeks we will turn available the submission section. Follow the issue discussion [[↗]](https://github.com/openuniverseorg/telescope/issues/1) to stay updated.

## Contribute
